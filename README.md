# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I use JUnit tests to validate functionality and catch errors. Input validation and exception handling prevent invalid or malicious data. For example, ContactService.java ensures unique IDs and enforces constraints to maintain security.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I analyze requirements and enforce constraints through validation. EX, Contact.java ensures IDs are unique and immutable, while AppointmentService.java prevents scheduling past appointments, aligning with user expectations.

# How do I approach designing software?
I follow a structured, test driven approach by requirements, designing classes, and creating unit tests. For example, TaskService.java prevents duplicate tasks, ensuring data is secured and can be scaled.
